   abstract = {We have extended our previous 2D method [Gerya, T.V., Yuen, D.A., 2003. Characteristics-based marker-in-cell method with conservative finite-differences schemes for modeling geological flows with strongly variable transport properties. Phys. Earth Planet. Interiors 140, 295–320], which is a combination of conservative finite-differences with marker-in-cell techniques to include the effects of visco-elasto-plastic rheology, self-gravitation and a self-consistently derived evolving curvilinear planetary surface. This code is called I2ELVIS and can solve a new class of computationally challenging problems in geodynamics, such as shear localization with large strains, crustal intrusion emplacement of magmas, bending of realistic visco-elasto-plastic plates and core-formation by vigorous shell tectonics activities related to a global Rayleigh–Taylor instability of a metal layer formed around silicate-rich lower density (primordial) core during planetary accretion. We discuss in detail the computational strategy required the rheological constraints to be satisfied at each time step and spatial location. We show analytical benchmarks and examples drawn from comparing between numerical and analogue experiments in structural geology, subducting slab bending with a visco-elasto-plastic rheology and equilibrium spherical configurations from self-gravitation. We have also tested possibilities of future applications by addressing 3D geometries based on multigrid method and including inertial effects in the momentum equation with tracers in order to simulate meteoritic impact events and eventually earthquake instabilities.},

   abstract = {We developed a new numerical model which can simulate the thermal history and metal-silicate separation of a growing Mars. In this model the thermal disturbance caused by planetesimal impacts is calculated for each impact event by taking into account the effects of shock heating, crater excavation, and isostatic rebound. A metallic blob is assumed to form at the base of a magma pond if an impact site is heated above the melting temperature. Sinking of the metal blobs is traced assuming Stokes' velocity. Their coalescence during sinking is treated by a Monte Carlo approach. A series of simulations is carried out assuming that Mars is formed by the runaway growth from a swarm of planetesimals as was suggested by recent numerical simulations of the planetary accretion process. Our numerical results show that (1) no global magma ocean is formed during accretion, (2) metal-silicate separation takes place without global scale melting, and (3) instead of a metallic core, a metal-rich layer is formed at the late stage of accretion.},
