\subsection{Visualisation with Paraview}

\subsubsection{Visualize composition}

Use the following pipeline:
\begin{enumerate}[-]
\item Threshold filter:\\
set upper and lower threshold to the same composition number. Don't set the 'All Scalars' option.

\item Contour filter:\\
Contour by composition. Choose x.001 as value for the isosurface.

\item GenerateSurfaceNormals filter:\\
This generates a polygonal mesh, which has a smoothing effect.
\end{enumerate}
